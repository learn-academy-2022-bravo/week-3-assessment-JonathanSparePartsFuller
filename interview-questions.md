# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: The `this` command is used to call methods that are in the same string. Instead of calling to the class and method, it allows coders to shortcut the code.

  Researched answer: `this` refers to an object and depending on what type of objects it is, changes how `this` keyword is called.



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React is a application created by Facebook to handle a large amount of users and their user interface. The reason you would use it is it's ability to quickly refresh a page when new inputs are added by other users.

  Researched answer: React is a JavaScript library which is used for user interfaces on web pages or mobile apps.



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: The constructor is the lifecycle method that is required. It allows the parents classes to pass data to the child classes without having to make the same information in the child classes.

  Researched answer: React has three lifecyle methods. Mounting, updating, and unmounting which help show and update what is shown on the web page through the DOM.



4. What is JSX? What is one notable difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: JSX is what React uses to make HTML tag codes in a JavaScript file. A notable difference between the two is you can't use JavaScript codes in a HTML file, but in JSX you can use both with some exceptions.

  Researched answer: JSX is a JavaScript extension which allows you to write JavaScript objects into HTML elements.



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: Yarn is a file manager which allows you to download specfic files that you need to assist you with making code. I'm not sure what those files are, but I do know when you run yarn with React it will open a window in your browser and displays the code in the React app.

  Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I don't know what that is, but from what it sounds like the anonymous function might be a hidden function in JavaScript that only works under certain circumstances.

  Researched answer: A function that hasn't been named.


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: Ability to mark true or false on a user interface

2. Object-oriented programming: 
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a style of programming characterized by the identification of classes of objects closely linked with the methods (functions) with which they are associated. It also includes ideas of inheritance of attributes and methods.

(Couldn't figure out how to make it into my own words)

3. Ruby: A general purpose program used to make anything from desktop applications to automations tools. Used in creating web servers and DevOps

4. Ruby blocks: Ruby blocks are anonymous functions that can be passed into methods. Blocks are enclosed in a do-end statement or curly braces {}. do-end is usually used for blocks that span through multiple lines while {} is used for single line blocks. Blocks can have arguments which should be defined between two pipe | characters.

(I really don't understand how this works)

5. Ruby hashes: In Ruby, Hash is a collection of unique keys and their values. Hash is like an Array, except the indexing is done with the help of arbitrary keys of any object type. In Hash, the order of returning keys and their value by various iterators is arbitrary and will generally not be in the insertion order.

(I spent 10 minutes trying to form this in my own words, but I just couldn't)
